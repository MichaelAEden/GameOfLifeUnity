# Game of Life 3D

Created with Unity.

## Background

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton on a 2-dimensional square grid. Each cell (square) will live, die, or reproduce depending on its neighbours.

This project extends Conway's Game of Life to 3-dimensions, and allows you to roam around the world of multiplying cells as a small marble.
